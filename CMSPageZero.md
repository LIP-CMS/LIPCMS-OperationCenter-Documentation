This page shows some of the current information related to the running status of CMS.

The page is divided into several tables.
The top table (labeled "Sub-detector DCS Status") indicates which of the CMS subdetectors are currently on as configured by the CMS DCS.
Each subdetector can be clicked on and detailed information of the voltage being supplied to the individual channels of the subdetector can be seen.

The table labeled "LHC" has information from LHC such as the current status as well as the fill number, which is a link leading to the [[FillReport]] of the current fill.
The "Magnet" table has information on the CMS superconducting solenoid, of note, the magnetic field and current in the solenoid.
The "CMS DAQ/Trigger" table
